# GS-Traffic2WIFI-FAKER
GS-Traffic2WIFI-Faker is an internal used Faker-Firmware for simulating Traffic for developing [GS-Traffic2WIFI](https://github.com/gs-avionik-gunnar/GS-Traffic2WIFI). The code is simple and stupid and needs no explain ;)
There is no final version and there will be no final version. You have to modify the code for your needs.


## Hardware-Compatibility / Used GPIO-Pins
The code is compatible with GS-Traffic2WIFI 1.0 Hardware. Please look at [GS-Traffic2WIFI](https://github.com/gs-avionik-gunnar/GS-Traffic2WIFI).

Feel free to modify and contribute!
